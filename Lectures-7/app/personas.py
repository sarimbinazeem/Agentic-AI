"""Personas for the reply graph.

Each persona is a system prompt + a body of content the LLM uses to
ground its answers. The bot answers /resume questions from your actual
resume, /services from your services catalog, /personal from your bio.

When no slash prefix is given, the `classify` node asks the LLM which
persona fits the message best.

CONTENT PLACEHOLDERS — replace with your real data before shipping.
